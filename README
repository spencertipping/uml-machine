I'm not responsible for what happens if you use this.

But if you want to try:

Step 1. Create a child that has its own setting for where disk images go.
$ ./uml-machine child ./my-uml-machine
$ ./my-uml-machine root-directory = /home/myname/images         # (can be other things too)

Step 2. Use that child to create a new Arch Linux instance.
$ ./my-uml-machine child my-arch-instance
$ ./my-arch-instance check
(Follow instructions to make sure the host is ready)
$ ./my-arch-instance create-image
$ ./my-arch-instance arch-init-image
$ ./my-arch-instance run

$ ./my-arch-instance rescue     # bash prompt inside mounted FS
$ ./my-arch-instance ip-address
$ ./my-arch-instance prefix     # all files live in here

Step 3. Later on, do a git pull and have everything update.
$ git pull
$ for file in *; do
    ./$file update -n
  done

Alternatives to Arch are Debian and Gentoo, specified by using debian-init-image
and gentoo-init-image, respectively.

Once your instance is running, a command called /sbin/netup should get networking
going between the host and other UML instances. It also initializes the routing
table so that your instance can connect to the Internet.
