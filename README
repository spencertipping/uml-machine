I'm not responsible for what happens if you use this.

But if you want to try:

$ ./uml-machine child my-arch-instance
$ ./my-arch-instance check
(Follow instructions to make sure the host is setup)
$ ./my-arch-instance create-image
$ ./my-arch-instance arch-init-image
$ ./my-arch-instance run

Alternatives to Arch are Debian and Gentoo, specified by using debian-init-image
and gentoo-init-image, respectively.
