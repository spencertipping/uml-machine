I'm not responsible for what happens if you use this.

But if you want to try:

$ ./uml-machine child my-arch-instance
$ ./my-arch-instance check
(Follow instructions to make sure the host is ready)
$ ./my-arch-instance create-image
$ ./my-arch-instance arch-init-image
$ ./my-arch-instance run

$ ./my-arch-instance rescue     # bash prompt inside mounted FS
$ ./my-arch-instance ip-address
$ ./my-arch-instance prefix     # all files live in here

Alternatives to Arch are Debian and Gentoo, specified by using debian-init-image
and gentoo-init-image, respectively.

Once your instance is running, a command called /sbin/netup should get networking
going between the host and other UML instances. It also initializes the routing
table so that your instance can connect to the Internet.
